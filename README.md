ðŸ§ª An open-source, all-pay auction game built onchain using <a href="https://scaffoldeth.io">Scaffold ETH2</a> with <a href="https://github.com/NikolaiL/miniapp-extension">Nikolai's MiniApp Extension.

## Quickstart

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd finalBid
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
